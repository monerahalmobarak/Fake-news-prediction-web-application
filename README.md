# Fake-news-prediction-web-application
As part of our Machine Learning course,
my team and I collaborated on developing a web application using machine learning and Flask to accurately
classify news articles as fake or not fake. Following the successful completion of the course, we were motivated to
further enhance our project. Leveraging the knowledge acquired during the AWS Solutions Architect (Associate) bootcamp at Tuwaiq Academy,
we expanded our project to AWS. To ensure optimal performance, high availability, and robust security, we deployed the application on servers 
across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This strategic decision allowed our application to leverage the advanced capabilities of AWS and 
enhance its overall functionality.
